## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `ng add @nrwl/angular`
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `ng add @nrwl/web`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/nest`
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/express`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/node`

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/nx-community) you could add.

## Generate an application

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are sharable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@gnt/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `ng build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.

## Chapter 1: Clean Code: Using Component + Presentational, Module, Libraries, 

Code is organised as below

- Application(folder): prioritisation (app) compose one library PriorityManage
- Main manage library ( maybe to rename  prioritisation)
        - Route to the relevant application shells (SandBoxes or facade) 
        - calls directly shared libraries ( such as authentication library)
        - Most Likely will use shared UI
- Shell(lib):         
  

- Domain(folder): prioritisation (a grouping folders)

- feature: 




### The Below is usually represent the horizontal layers in  front end application

## Clean Code 
In order to achieve clean clode below principle are applied
Separation of concern using angular eco-system features (component, module, library)
Dependency management and Injection (e.g. Injection of service)
Enforcing module boundaries 
Business logic	Application-specific logic, domain logic, validation rules
Persistence	WebStorage, IndexedDB, WebSQL, HTTP, WebSocket, GraphQL, Firebase, Meteor
Messaging	WebRTC, WebSocket, Push API, Server-Sent Events
I/O	Web Bluetooth, WebUSB, NFC, camera, microphone, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor
Presentation	DOM manipulation, event listeners, formatting
User interaction	UI behaviour, form validation
State management	Application state management, application-specific events
